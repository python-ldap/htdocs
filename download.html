<h2>Releases on PyPI</h2>
<p>
  The preferred point for downloading the 'official' source distribution
  is now the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-ldap/">PyPI repository</a>
  which supports installing via setuptools.
</p>
<p>
  The documentation contains
  <a href="doc/html/installing.html">detailed build instructions</a>.
</p>

<h2>Binaries</h2>

<p>
  Because distributions seem to be all over the place, this page
  tries to list all the current ones we know of.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the python-ldap team is not responsible for the binary packages
  except the binaries you can grab from the PyPI page. Also note that binary
  packages are most times not up to date. If you experience troubles
  with a binary package it would be nice if you try to build a recent version
  of python-ldap before submitting a bug report to make sure you did not
  hit a problem already fixed in recent releases.
